# Audio-Quantisation-for-Fixed-Point-and-Floating-Point
For comparing fixed point and floating point formats

This code can go ahead and process an audio file (dog1.wav by default. You need the soundfile library. FIR lowpass filter is applied  and fixed and float point arithmetic is simulated. MSE, SNR are computed for each of the non-float32 formats. Filter outputs and error signals aer plotted
